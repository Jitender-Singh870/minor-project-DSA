# Minor Project: Crossword

This project is a **command-line word guessing game** built using C and fundamental concepts of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**. It randomly selects a word from a large word bank, hides it, and lets the player guess letters with limited chances. The project demonstrates usage of **linked lists, string handling, randomization, and control structures** â€” all packed into a simple, interactive terminal game.
